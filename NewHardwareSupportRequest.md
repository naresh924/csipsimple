# **WARNING : Except for armv4 architecture, this procedure is now obsolete** #

The new audio driver is now based on JNI calls (less performant but more stable).

So the private API is not used anymore. And any incompatibility should now be reported in the Issues section.

The issue with armv4 will be treated as a separate issue (See Issues).

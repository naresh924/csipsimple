# Introduction #

SIP is an open protocol to do Voice Over IP.

CSipSimple is just a SIP client. It is not a SIP provider.
To use a SIP client application you need a SIP provider.

# Comparison with other internet technologies #
If we had to compare SIP to other things you are probably more familiar with :

  * SIP is a little bit like HTTP is an open protocol to navigate the internet.
To navigate the web you can use several http client ... it's called web browser. There is Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera on desktop and also the stock android browser on your android device (but also if you installed it Dolphin, Firefox Mobile or Opera Mobile).

To be able to navigate the web you need the webbrowser (the client) + the content provider : this webpage for example (the server).
  * Another comparison that is more close cause it requires an authentication is emails.

To send and receive emails you need a service provider (gmail.com, yahoo.com, ...) and a client application (Outlook, Thunderbird, or online client such as www.gmail.com). The client application allow you to use the open protocols that allow users to communicate with each others. It goes the same way with SIP.

Besides in SIP it goes the same way than for emails, since this is an open protocol, you can contact (call) somebody that has another provider than you ! In SIP there is the same concept of addresses just like email addresses !

# SIP providers #
There is many providers around the world.
You can find a list of SIP providers here : http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/VOIP+Service+Providers+Residential or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIP_provider.

CSipSimple is not linked to any provider.

You are **FREE** to choose the one you prefer. You can have a look to existing wizard inside CSipSimple if you want to get ideas, but there is other providers that are not yet listed in CSipSimple.

Most providers offers free calls for SIP to SIP calls.
In some countries Internet Service Providers offers a SIP account with an internet access and allow users to call for free PSTN network (for example in France 2 out of the 3 ISP provide free SIP account that allow to make free landline calls).

So it really depends on what you want to do and where you are.
But what is sure, is that there is necessarily at least one SIP providers that fit your needs.
Most allow you to create free account and do SIP to SIP calls and make you pay for call to standard phone network (in this case they are a gateway between voice over IP and classic voice).

But remember, CSipSimple is not linked to any provider and you are free to choose the one you prefer ! That's the open world ;)
Besides, unlike Skype and other proprietary ways to communicate. Having a SIP account leave free your contacts to choose their own SIP provider !

Once you have choose a SIP provider, they will explain you how to configure a SIP client to connect their service and you'll be able to configure it on CSipSimple then.

# Where can I use my SIP account #
SIP is an open standard and as consequence is available in almost all platforms.

There is others SIP clients for Android (IMSDroid, Linphone, SipDroid...). We'd even advise you to test other SIP clients, maybe they work better or fit more your needs than CSipSimple.

There is also SIP clients for iPhone, Nokia, Blackberry, PC, Mac, and there is also physical SIP phones that you can directly plug to an IP network.

So if you get a SIP account, you'll be able to use this account not only on your mobile and not only with CSipSimple !

Welcome to an open world of communication.
